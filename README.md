============
this is a work in progress and still contains some errors

instructions for admins:
------------------------
1) start the server and log in.
2) execute command /prep as op, NOT as the server
3) DON'T MOVE and put in the command /genmap. This will kick you from the server and generate the borders
4) if your world wasn't pregenerated before you've made the server you'll need to go around your borders to generate the chunks and afterwards redo step 2 en 3 (don't mind the error during step 2, that's because it's resetting the scoreboard). When you rejoin your server for a 3th time, you'll need to do only step 2 1 more time
5) now set a world spawn somewhere you would like people to spawn with regular commands
6) following Mindcrack UHC, there is a timer inside the game standard put to 20 minutes. change this to wathever amount of minutes you want the timer to go of as a reminder to people how much time has past. If you don't want it to go off, putt in a large number like 1440 (24 hours) in order for the message to not appear ;)
7) use /teamup to generate random teams (this command is necessary in order for the next steps to work). you need to put in between 2 and 16 teams, the plugin will distribute everyone as even as possible ;)
8) do /uhcsetup to spread everyone
9) if your team is ready, do /ready otherwise do unready if you change your mind
10) once every team has confirmed to be ready, uhc will start
11) have fun with UHC :p
