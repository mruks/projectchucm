============
this is a work in progress and still contains some errors

instructions for admins:
------------------------
1) start the server and log in.
2) execute command prep as op, NOT as the server
3) DON'T MOVE and put in the command genmap. This will kick you from the server
4) wait until the server has been closed, DO NOT TRY TO ENTER IT EARLIER!!!
5) set worldspawn where you think is best
6-8) these are still under cunstruction
9) have fun with UHC :p
